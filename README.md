# Iris-KNN
This program builds KNN for Iris data set from scratch. 
Noise is added in incremental fashion ie first 10 labels are flipped followed by 20 ,30 ,50
For each of the noise , KNN is run and decision boundary is plotted LOOCV (leave one out cross validation)
This gives an intuition on how KNN works for noise in the training data.
