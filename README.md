# Iris-KNN
This program builds KNN for Iris data set from scratch. 
Noise is added in incremental fashion ie labels of 10 data points are flipped ,KNN is run and decision boundary is plotted LOOCV (leave one out cross validation)
Similarly 20,40,50 datapoint labels are flipped, and decision boundary is plotted.
This gives an intuition on how KNN works for noise in the training data.
